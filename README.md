Clone of the game [Threes](https://asherv.com/threes/) using SDL2, written to learn F# and made for a two week coding jam.

## In progress

- Animations
- A game over screen
- More integrated SDL2 bindings

The AI branch contains an attempt to create a Deep Q Network based on the game, however results are currently poor and a lot of work needs to be done.
